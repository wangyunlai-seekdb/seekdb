# Project Agent Guidance

## C++ Type Naming

- New C++ classes, including interface classes, do not need the legacy `Ob` prefix.
- Keep the `I` prefix for interface classes. For example, use `ICacheMemoryGetter` instead of `ObICacheMemoryGetter`.
- Do not rename existing types only to remove the `Ob` prefix unless the task explicitly requires it.

## C++ Struct Initialization

- Initialize members of newly added C++ structs at their declarations, using brace-or-equal initializers. Do not use a constructor initializer list only to establish member defaults.

## Code Review

- For pull request or diff review tasks, read and follow `.agents/skills/code-review/SKILL.md`.
